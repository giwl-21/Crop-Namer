# Crop-Namer
This program is for bulk-renaming scanned files.  It first asks the user to choose a folder.  It opens the first file with a name beginning with "scan", and prompts the user to box the area of the page number/intended title.   It then crops the given area and names it the text inside that box; then does the same in the same area to the other "scan" images in the folder.
